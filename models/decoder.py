class Decoder(nn.Module):
    ''' Decoder class.

    As discussed in the paper, we implement the OccupancyNetwork
    f and TextureField t in a single network. It consists of 5
    fully-connected ResNet blocks with ReLU activation.

    Args:
        dim (int): input dimension
        z_dim (int): dimension of latent code z
        c_dim (int): dimension of latent conditioned code c
        hidden_size (int): hidden size of Decoder network
        leaky (bool): whether to use leaky ReLUs
        n_blocks (int): number of ResNet blocks
        out_dim (int): output dimension (e.g. 1 for only
            occupancy prediction or 4 for occupancy and
            RGB prediction)
        res0 (bool): use learnable resnet or not
        res0ini (callable): initialization methods for learnable resnet
